# billingSystem
Customer Billing System Project is a basic console application aimed to show the actual usage of the programming language C and its capabilities, as well as to build an app that can be used for billing to customers in any department store.

You may use this program to keep records of your frequent customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, paid amounts, due amounts, payment dates, and so on. Furthermore, if you have a new client, you may add and change their account at any moment.
